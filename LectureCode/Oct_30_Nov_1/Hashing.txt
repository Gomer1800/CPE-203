What if you have a large array of strings data pairs
You want to quickly find a particular string and its associated data

    "name" - data

Sorting Methods & time?
    Linear search: O(n/2)
    Binary search: O(log_base2_n), you sort the whole list in some order then
        divide the list in half and check the middle element, eliminating half the stack
        with each iteration.

Hashing

    Student
        String last, first, middle
        int dateOfBirth
        double gpa

// overriding Object's hashCode method
// our hashCode creates a custom hashCode that is made up by the hashCode of the 

        public int hashCode() 
            int result s1.getLast().hashcode() +
                s1.getFirst().hashCode() +
                s1.getMiddle().hashCode() +
                si.getDateOfBirth +
                ((Double) s1.getDPA()).hashCode();
        }
we can can call the overriden function s1.hashCode()
on our student object
