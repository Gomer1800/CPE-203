ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE
1) HOW?
The event is triggered by clicking and releasing any mouse button. This was achieved through the use of the mouseClicked() method provided by Processing.

2) WHAT?
The Zombie Apocalypse will create a Tombstone at the point of selection and will kill all dwarves in the nearby vicinity, as well as wilting all of the background tiles turning the area into a barren patch of dirt (Area of Effect is a 5 by 5 square area). These tombstones periodically create piles of Bones in their immediate vicinity which in turn have a random chance to spawn a Zombie. The Zombies will actively chase all miners, regardless of Full/NotFull, and when they catch a miner they will infect the miner with a cloud of plague gas which kills the miner and animates the him/her as a new Zombie. Currently there is no way for the miners to win.

In the future I would like to give the Miners the ability to fight back with fire and the ability to respawn.

3) AFFECTED ENTITIES:
MINERS: They will be killed by the Event and replaced by Tomb entities.

4) NEW ENTITIES:
TOMBS: stationary, spawns bones
BONES: stationary, "hatches" a Zombie
ZOMBIES: mobile, hunts miners, spreads plague
PLAGUE_CLOUD: stationary, spawns zombie
